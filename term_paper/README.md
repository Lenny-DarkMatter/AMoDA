# Final project
I still have to decide between two possible Projects:
* Classification with artificial neural networks (Higgs to Bottom Quark-Antiquark pair) using keras
* Multidimensional density estimation with normalizing flows (RR-Lyrae, variable stars) using Tensorflow 2

Edit: I decided for the latter because I was interested in how precise the density estimation can be calculated on my laptop. Further the RR Lyrae have some connection to my Master in Astrophysics, but the theory was not that important.
