# Term paper: Tensorflow

This folder contains everything I worked with when experimenting. It is important to note, that most of the code is based on code by Lukas Rinder (https://github.com/LukasRinder/normalizing-flows/, the folder `normalizing-flows`), so the credit for the implementation of the different papers goes to him, while my contribution was in tweaking the architecutres (mainly NSF) to the problem of building a classifier for RR Lyrae stars. The paper can also be found here.
